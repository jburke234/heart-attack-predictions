# Heart Attack Predictions
A Machine Learning project that involves the from scratch (with no libraries) implementation of K-Nearest Neighbor aiming to predict potential heart attacks. The project also investigates the impact of different distance calculations on the accuracy of predictions.

# K-Nearest Neighbor
In KNN when a new data point is submitted the closest existing datapoints in the training set are located. These data points are then used to make a prediction for the new data point.
    
To achieve this we can calculate the distances between each of the data points in the training set. It is also used to find the nearest neighbour to the new data point. 
    
The prediction for the new data point is made using the average result of the nearest neighbours.
