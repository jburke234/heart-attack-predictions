# Heart Attack Predictions
A Machine Learning project that involves the from scratch (with no libraries) implementation of K-Nearest Neighbor aiming to predict potential heart attacks. The reason for a from scratch implementation is to develop a better understanding of how KNN works.

There are three areas of evaulation conducted by measuring the accuracy of the predictions made by the KNN model. 
1. The number of folds in the K-Fold cross validation 
2. The number of neighbors 
3. The impact of different distance calculations

Below is a discussion of each of the aspects of the project followed by the results observed and the conclusions drawn.

# K-Fold Cross Validation 
- Discuss K-Fold Validation 

# K-Nearest Neighbor
In KNN when a new data point is submitted the closest existing datapoints in the training set are located. These data points are then used to make a prediction for the new data point.
    
To achieve this we can calculate the distances between each of the data points in the training set. It is also used to find the nearest neighbour to the new data point. 
    
The prediction for the new data point is made using the average result of the nearest neighbours.

# Euclidean Distance
- Represents the shortest distance between two points 


# Hamming Distance
- The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.
